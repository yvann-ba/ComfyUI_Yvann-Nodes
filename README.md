## Nodes

### Node: Audio Reactive üîä

Analyzes audio input to generate **audio-reactive weights** and visualizations. It can extract specific elements from the audio, such as **drums**, **vocals**, **bass**, or analyze the **full audio**. Using AI-based audio separator [open-unmix](https://github.com/sigsep/open-unmix-pytorch), it separates these components from the input audio

><details>
>  <summary><i>Node Parameters</i></summary>
>
>  - **batch_size**: The number of audio frames to process
>  - **fps**: Frames per second for processing audio weights, the output of your animation need to have the same fps to be correctly synchronized
>  - **audio**: Input audio file
>  - **analysis_mode**: Selects the audio component to analyze (**Drums Only**, **Full Audio**, **Vocals Only**, **Bass Only**, **Other Audio**). This analysis is performed using AI-based audio separation models (open-unmix)
>  - **threshold**: Filters the audio weights based on sound intensity (only values above the threshold pass through)
>  - **add**: Adds a constant value to all the weights
>  - **smooth**: Smoothing factor to reduce sharp transitions between weights
>  - **multiply**: Multiplication factor to amplify the weights
>  - **add_range**: Expands the range of the weights to control output dynamic range
>  - **invert_weights**: Inverts the audio weights
>
>  **Outputs**:
>  - **audio_weights**: A float list of audio-reactive weights based on the processed audio
>  - **processed_audio**: The separated or processed audio (e.g., drums, vocals) used in the analysis
>  - **original_audio**: The original audio input without modifications
>  - **audio_visualization**: An image displaying a graph of the audio weights over time, representing the variation in intensity across the analyzed frames

The node parameters allow manual adjustment, offering fine-grained control over how the audio data is interpreted and converted into weights for reactive animations or visual effects

### Node: Floats To Weights Strategy üõ†Ô∏è

Converts a list of floats to IPAdapter weights strategy, useful to use "IPAdapter Weights From Strategy" & "Prompt Schedule From Weights Strategy" from any float list, this way you can give the audio_weights from my audio nodes to the [IPAdapter](https://github.com/cubiq/ComfyUI_IPAdapter_plus) pipeline 

<details>
  <summary><i>Node Parameters</i></summary>

  - **floats**: The list of float values to be converted into a weights strategy
  - **batch_size**: The number of frames you want to proceed

  **Outputs**:
  - **WEIGHTS_STRATEGY**: A dictionary containing the weights strategy used by IPAdapter, including the weights and related parameters

### Node: Floats Visualizer üõ†Ô∏è

This node generates a visualization of one or more list of floats. It plots the provided float lists on a graph, allowing you to visually analyze the data, Useful if you want to compare the audio weights of differents Audio Reactive instance, for example one with your drums weights, one with your vocal weights etc...

<details>
  <summary><i>Node Parameters</i></summary>

  - **floats**: The primary list of float values to visualize
  - **title**: Title of the graph
  - **x_label**: Label for the x-axis
  - **y_label**: Label for the y-axis
  - **floats_optional2**: (Optional) A second list of float values to include in the visualization
  - **floats_optional3**: (Optional) A third list of float values to include in the visualization

  **Outputs**:
  - **visual_graph**: An image displaying the graph of the provided float sequences

### Node: Invert Floats üõ†Ô∏è

This node inverts all the individuals values of a list of floats

<details>
  <summary><i>Node Parameters</i></summary>

  - **floats**: The list of float values to invert

  **Outputs**:
  - **floats_invert**: The inverted list of float values, where all the individual values have been inversed
